/// Optimization-based path planning method.
///
/// #### Sketch of the method
///
/// Given two configurations \f$ (q_1,q_2) \f$, this class formulates and
/// solves the problem as follows.
/// - Compute the corresponding states \f$ (s_1, s_2) \f$.
/// - For each path \f$ (e_0, ... e_n) \f$ of length not more than
///   parameter "StatesPathFinder/maxDepth" between
///   \f$ (s_1, s_2)\f$ in the constraint graph, do:
///   - define \f$ n-1 \f$ intermediate configuration \f$ p_i \f$,
///   - initialize the optimization problem, as explained below,
///   - solve the optimization problem, which gives \f$ p^*_i \f$,
///   - in case of failure, continue the loop.
///
/// #### Problem formulation
/// Find \f$ (p_i) \f$ such that:
/// - \f$ p_0 = q_1 \f$,
/// - \f$ p_{n+1} = q_2 \f$,
/// - \f$ p_i \f$ is in state between \f$ (e_{i-1}, e_i) \f$, (\ref
/// StateFunction)
/// - \f$ (p_i, p_{i+1}) \f$ are reachable with transition \f$ e_i \f$ (\ref
/// EdgeFunction).
///
/// #### Problem resolution
///
/// One solver (hpp::constraints::solver::BySubstitution) is created
/// for each waypoint \f$p_i\f$.
/// - method buildOptimizationProblem builds a matrix the rows of which
///   are the parameterizable numerical constraints present in the
///   graph, and the columns of which are the waypoints. Each value in the
///   matrix defines the status of each constraint right hand side for
///   this waypoint, among {absent from the solver,
///                         equal to value for previous waypoint,
///                         equal to value for start configuration,
///                         equal to value for end configuration}.
/// - method analyseOptimizationProblem loops over the waypoint solvers,
///   tests what happens when solving each waypoint after initializing
///   only the right hand sides that are equal to the initial or goal
///   configuration, and detects if a collision is certain to block any attempts
///   to solve the problem in the solveOptimizationProblem step.
/// - method solveOptimizationProblem tries to solve for each waypoint after
///   initializing the right hand sides with the proper values, backtracking
///   to the previous waypoint if the solving failed or a collision is
///   detected a number of times set from the parameter
///   "StatesPathFinder/nTriesUntilBacktrack". If too much backtracking
///   occurs, the method can eventually return false.
/// - eventually method buildPath build paths between waypoints with
///   the constraints of the transition in which the path lies.
///
/// #### Current status
///
/// The method has been successfully tested with romeo holding a placard
/// and the construction set benchmarks. The result is satisfactory
/// except between pregrasp and grasp waypoints that may be far
/// away from each other if the transition between those state does
/// not contain the grasp complement constraint. The same holds
/// between placement and pre-placement.
